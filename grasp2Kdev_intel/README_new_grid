Update on how the dynamic grid parameters are set-up and transferred between all grid-dependent routines.

   A slightly more descriptive pdf document is available as-well, just send an email and ask for it.

1) Idea

- Extend "isodata" to also include information about RNT, H, HP and NNNP
- Make all routines working on the grid read this information instead of having to run the non-default options

2) Update

a) make-environment_gfort
   - It is a bit clumsy to go libs in order to modify the grid in parameters.def.
     The parameter file is therefore set up directly in the make-environment file in the grasp root directory
   - The only thing the user has to do is to define the flag $NNNP='number of grid-points' and then as usual 
     source the environment file. Hopefully this will be more straightforward for an inexperienced user.

b) GENISO / GENISO.F
   - geniso.f now asks if the user wants default grid parameters or input new values
   - if yes, default values are written to isodata (NNNP is then taken from parameters.def)

c) LIB92 / LODISO.F
   - The LODISO lib92-subroutine (which is called by SETISO) now also reads the grid parameters RNT, H, HP 
     and NNNP from isodata and stores them in the GRID common-block.

d) ERWF / GETINF.F
   - Calls the SETISO subroutine above, which defines the grid parameters. Thus there is no need for default
     values to be given inside the code. The lines where this takes place in erwf/getinf.f is therfore commented 
     out.

e) RSCF      / GETSCD.F
   RCI       / GETCID.F
   RCI_MPI   / GETCID.F
   BIOTRA    / RADPAR.F
   BIOSCL    / GETOSD.F
   RHFS      / GETHFD.F
   RIS       / GETSMD.F
   HFSZEEMAN / GETHFD.F
   - Same as in the ERWF case above, the internal parameter definitions are commented out as SETISO --> LODISO is 
     loading them directly from isodata instead.
