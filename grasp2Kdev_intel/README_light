GRASP2k_light
Jon Grumer, Lund, 2013-04-16

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a light version of grasp2k containing only the newest routines.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The version number of the codes (eg rci3) has been removed, so binaries
are now called for example mcp, rscf, rci, and so on. Note that no change
has been made to the actual source files, just the Makefiles and foldernames.

ADDITIONAL ROUTINES ------------------------------------------------------------
An EXTRA source-folder, src/extra, contains some extra tools appart from
the standard grasp-tools. For example routines to reorder or reduce CSF-lists.
The idea is to put newly developed tools in this folder.

HFSZEEMAN is included in src/appl.

RIS is included in src/appl.

The two additional tools that are part of the RIS-package, 
RIS_LSJ and RISOSUPPORT,
are put in src/tools among the other grasp tools.

INSTALLATION ------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation procedure is as normal
1) Setup your make_environment_xxxxx file
2) Source the same file
3) Do make clean; make; make clean; in src/ (or in each subdir)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
