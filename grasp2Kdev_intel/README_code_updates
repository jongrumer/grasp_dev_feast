            GRASP2K_LIGHT UPDATES DOC
-----------------------------------------------------------
Please add description of updates of the grasp2k_light code
in the following format

Date  : YYYY-MM-DD
User  : Grasp Graspsson
Code  : Affected code(s), such as rci or bioscl
Update: Short description of patch and which subroutines 
        that are changed.
-----------------------------------------------------------

Date  : 2013 Spring
User  : Jon Grumer
Code  : Grasp2k_light
Update: Removed old versions of codes to make the package more 
        easy to grasp (<-- Obs! pun!) and added the folder extra wich 
        contains newly written small applications such as orbreduce or
        zero_first_order_space.

        Modified Makefiles and the src/ folder tree.

Date  : 2013-10-
User  : Jon Grumer
Code  : All grid dependent codes + iso
Update: Included grid parameters in isodata and modified all applications
        and libs to read this info. Makes it much easier to run with a 
        non-default grid. The major difference during runtime is that
        iso now asks questions concerning the grid, appart from that the experience 
        will be exactly the same as running with the default grid. The default
        grid will be the one set by isodata!
        
        Please ask Jon (jongrumer@gmail.com/jon.grumer@teorfys.lu.se) 
        if you need more info.

Code  : rci, rci_mpi
Update: Added Per's patch of rci/rci_mpi from 2013-04-13 defining 
        the ATWINV variable in setham_gg.f as below. Related to 
        mass shift.

        !Per Bug fix 30/4-2013
            ATWINV = 1.D0/EMN

Code  : rci_mpi
Update: NELMNT which is the number of non-zero elements in rci overflows 
        for large cases. Added a patch by the Brussels people (T Carette)
        which declares the shared NELMNT_a as an integer*8 variable in 
        subroutines genmat2.f, maneig.f and matrix.f.

        In some more detail, NELMNT is a PRIVATE integer*4 keeping track
        of the number of nonzero matrix elements of each task. All these
        counters are summed up (with an All_reduce call) to the SHARED 
        variable NELMNT_a which now is declared as integer*8.

User  : Per Jonsson
Code  : lib92, libmpi, rci, rscf
        inetger has been updated to integer*8 as described in attached
        latex document rci_overflow.tex

Date  : 2014-03-04
User  : Per Jonsson
Code  : rscf, integer*8 has been commented out. Did not work. If this is 
        to work, similar change needs to be done in mcp. For the future

Date  : 2014-03-04
User  : Per Jonsson
Code  : erwf, a subroutine canonical has been added. The subroutine arranges
        the orbitals in canonical order before any estimates are done. This
        mean that the orthogonalization will always be correct whatever orbital
        order of the rcsl.inp list 

Date  : 2014-07-28
User  : Per Jonsson
Code  : erwf, dimensions in the two variables in canonical has been increased to 1000                

Date  : 2014-07-28
User  : Per Jonsson
Code  : jjreduce_breit, in mcp_gg line1 has been redimensioned to 1000 (similar change in the loop)

Date  : 2014-07-28
User  : Per Jonsson
Code  : jjgen, in fivefirst. Change has been done in order to correctly write out the string of Peel shells
