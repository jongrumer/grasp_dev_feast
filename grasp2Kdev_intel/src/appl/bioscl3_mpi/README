Ideas:

Use MPI_Allreduce in csfm.f to combine contributions to
ASFA and ASFB

How do you deal with directories???

Notice that startmpi2 sets up a local directory and GOES there!

Could add a permanent directory path to NAME(1) and NAME(2),
but then how do I form double names??
NO! Don't put paths there because angular files 
name1.name2.T are going to reside in the temporary directories!

How about having 2 arrays -- NAME(2) and FULLNAME(2) ???
Also, I will need to broadcast NAME(2) to all of the nodes!
