*   This program calculates the transition parameters for a            *
*   transition between an initial and a final state                    *
*   The program assumes that the radial orbitals of the initial        *
*   and final state have been transformed by the BIOTRA program        *
*   as to become biorthonormal, in which case the normal Racah         *
*   algebra can be used.                                               *
