Normal orbital order
1s,2s,2p,3s,3p,3d,4s,4p,4d,4f  etc

Reversed orbital order
4f,4d,4p,4s,3d,3p,3s,2p,2s,1s 

When you generate a CSF list using orbitals with  normal order 
and run jjreduce_breit (jjreduce) you get a reduction of the 
number of CSFs

When you generate a CSF list using orbitals with reversed order 
and run jjreduce_breit (jjreduce) you get a reduction of the 
number of CSFs that is MUCH larger

The CSFs in the two cases spann approximately the same space.

How you use this in practice

a) Run with normal orbital order just as before up to the limit where
you can not increase the orbital set anymore, say up to n=8
b) Use jjgen with reversed orbital order and generate CSFs with an additional orbital set, example n = 9
Run jjreduce_breit (jjreduce) and now you will get less CSFs so that you can run again. NIOTE THAT THE MRLIST
ALSO NEED TO BE REVERSED
c) To get initial estimates of the last orbital layer n=9 please use erwfr. Here you will get the question if normal
or reversed orbital order. Choose reversed orbital order. 
If you use the new erwfr then the program would
generate estimates of the new orbital layer n=9 and then it would orthogonalize the new orbitals against the old ones
n = 1,..,8 and this is correct


If you would use the old erwf then the program would
generate estimates of the new orbital layer n=9 and then it would orthogonalize the inner already known orbitals against 
the outer layer and this is wrong.

d) Once you have generated the additional orbital layer using rscf and reversed order this could be followed by an
RCI calculation using normal order. It is not a good idea to do the RCI calculation in reverse order since biotra is not
working using reversed order. Additionally we dont get the good labels.
