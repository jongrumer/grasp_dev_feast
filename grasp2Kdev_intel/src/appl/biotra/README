Observe that the program can not handle
cases like

1s,2s,3s,3p,3d    -   1s,2p,3s,3p,3d  

but

1s,2s,2p,3s,3d    -   1s,2s,2p,3p,3d

Modifications done to 

kapdata and ti1tv

to allow for
reversed orbital ordering.

Changes done to 

fname and mcp

to be able to specify which J symmetries that should be
transformed.

Changes done in

biotr1 

to be able to handle cases like 3s2p1d 3s2p

Changes done in

mcp and qqsort

in order to re-use old angular data
